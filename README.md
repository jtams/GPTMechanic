# GPT Mechanic

GPT Mechanic is a site that uses OpenAI's, a company founded by Elon Musk, to answer car related questions. It will list the tools and steps needed to fix a specific problem on a car, it can help diagnose problems based on the given symptoms, it can explain how certain car things work, and even understand car culture.

OpenAI invited a small group of developers to the private API of GPT-3, a powerful generative natural language model. After messing around with hours with it, I found it was mind-blowingly good at answering car questions. I worked with an racecar fleet technician to help verify its answers and fine tune its responses.

In order for a project to go live using GPT-3, OpenAI must verify it so until then, this website only works for a very small group of users. Hopefully soon it'll be open up to the public.

Once this website is completly public, there will be a fee to use it. The reason for this fee is to prevent the OpenAI servers from being spammed or abused. Second, OpenAI's API uses a pay-per-use model when making a request and as I quickly figured out, it's very easy to spend too much.
